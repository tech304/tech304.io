  <h2>tech304 Code of Conduct</h2>

  <p>The tech304 Slack is a positively-minded, technology focused community group that recognizes and celebrates the creativity and collaboration of independent members and their diversity of skills, talents, experiences, cultures, and opinions that they bring to our community.</p>

  <p>The tech304 Slack is an inclusive group dedicated to treating all people equally, regardless of gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or freedom from), or physical appearance.</p>

  <p>We value respectful behavior above individual opinions.</p>

  <p>Respectful behavior includes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.</li>
    <li>Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.</li>
    <li>If you’re not sure, ask someone instead of assuming. No, really. Just ask the administrators. We’d rather hear from you than hear about something you said or did after the fact, and we are here to help.</li>
    <li>Don’t be a bystander. Role model respectful behaviour, but also help to address disrespect when you see it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Resolve peacefully</h2>

  <p>We believe peer to peer discussions, feedback, and corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community.</p>

  <p>If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, we urge you to respectfully dissuade them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful, and welcome your input in doing so.</p>

  <p>If you experience disrespectful behavior toward yourself or anyone else and feel in any way unable or unwilling to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of an administrator/moderator. We want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, or just something that could make someone feel distressed in any way. We will listen and work to resolve the matter.</p>

  <h2>Apologize for mistakes</h2>

  <p>Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, listen intently, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them and that you avoid repeating them in the future.</p>

  <h2>Harassment</h2>

  <p>Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of discussions or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

  <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>

  <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please notify an <a href="/moderators/">administrator/moderator</a> immediately, or via <a href="mailto:tech304@intarwebs.com">email</a>.</p>

  <h2>Consequences</h2>

  <p>If the administrators determine that someone is behaving disrespectfully, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate within this Slack team, up to and including expulsion and exclusion from the Team.</p>

  <p>As administrators, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. We can’t foresee every situation, and thus if in the administrator's judgment the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave, we will do so.</p>

  <h2>Role of Administrators</h2>

  <p>Our community is focused on individual remediation of conflict, as outlined above. If one on one conflict resolution is not possible our administrators will step in.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Mitigate or remediate conflict as appropriate.</li>
    <li>Monitor the public channels for inappropriate behavior.</li>
    <li>Have rights in the system tied to the admin role.</li>
    <li>Set adhoc policy to resolve immediate disputes.</li>
    <li>Close discussion of meta-items.</li>
  </ul>
